# ResSet16 mod version
This is a mod version of ResSet16 from sourcelocation: https://github.com/sourcelocation/ResSet16

I use it every day and I want to change it a little to make my phone better :)

1. Added dropdown picker for easy selection resolution: my iPhone13 , 14 Pro Max, 14 Pro and 14 Plus
2. At "set resolution" button have a confirmation dialog will pop up before modifying
3. Store user-favorite custom resolution records for easy modification after restart phone or restart app.
4. Check update from my repo

Special thanks to sourcelocation.
